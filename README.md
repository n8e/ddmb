## Start here

1. This app has two parts. The front end (`app`) and the API (`api`).
2. `cd api && yarn install` to install API dependencies, then `yarn start`.
3. `cd .. && cd app && yarn install` to install client-side dependencies, then `yarn start`
4. A browser window is automatically opened at `http://localhost:3000`. The app is ready.
